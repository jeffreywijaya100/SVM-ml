# SVM-ml
2. Super Vector Machine(SVM) is a set of supervised learning methods used for classification, regression, and other detection.

   a) What makes SVM different with other machine learning models?
   
   b) Perform dataset creation as instructed in the code below:

   c) Using the dataset you created before, perform training and testing using two different tuning sets of linear kernel SVM model. Train and test ratio is 80:20.

   d)Using the dataset you created before, perform training and testing using two different tuning sets of Radial Basis Function(RBF) SVM model. Train and test ratio is 80:20.

   e) Based on experiments 2c and 2d complete the following table:

   f) Perform analysis based on obtained results in Table 2.2. (Sugesstion: discuss which one is the best, then why, which one is the worst, then why.)
